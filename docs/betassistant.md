Welcome!  I'm glad you are curious as to how 
BetAssistant Works.

A couple freinds of mine decided to launch a
twitter page and corresponding discord
promoting their picks on Fantasy Sports App
PrizePicks.

After giving me access, I noticed many of their 
selections were justified by lines on the more
mainstream gambling site DraftKings.

So, I created a bot that can instantaneously
compare the lines between the two pages using
the public API's both sites offer. 

The results are then spit out by a discord bot
when called by the user.
